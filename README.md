# Gadabout

Gadabout is a feed reader for WebVR. It can connect to [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/) compatible 
feeds and is built upon the [Carnival Framework](http://github.com/ajrowr/carnival), which I am the creator 
and maintainer of.

Gadabout is a very new app and as such is not yet very sophisticated, elegant or pretty; but I already use it 
daily for my own feed reading so no doubt I will be improving it as spare time permits.

Currently only HTC Vive is supported, I hope to add support for other platforms to the framework soon.

## About me

I'm [Alan Rowarth](http://twitter.com/ajrowr) and I'm building frameworks and infrastructure for the spatial web. I'm determined that Virtual Reality will be a democratic medium and I believe that the best way to do this is to create easy-to-use tools, outside of megacorp control, for people to build whatever they can imagine. I'm just one guy - a hacker without a backer - and I'd love to have your help and/or support.
